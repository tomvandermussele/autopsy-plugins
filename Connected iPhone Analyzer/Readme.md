# Connected iPhone Analyzer


The plugin will investigate .plist files related to iTunes backups within a Windows environment.
This could be an indicator of connected devices to a Windows environment.
In order to connect and backup an iPhone, typically a passcode or fingerprint is required which could change the value of reliability as evidence.

#### Notes

The plugins have been tested on a Windows 7 x64 and Autopsy versions:
